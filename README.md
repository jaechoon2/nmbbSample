<h1>Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone</h1>
<h2>Cloud Hosting Mongo with MongoHQ</h2>
<p>This is the example source code from Chapter 10 accompanying O'Reilly's
    "Building Node Applications with MongoDB and Backbone" by Mike Wilson.</p>
<p>fixed up a few typos and case errors. The Cloud9 IDE is strict with respect to
module nams... minor edits to run in the Cloud9 IDE were required.  Although this 
example SocialNet app has a simple UI on the client it is still full featured and 
showcasese a full functioning NodeJS based server with MongoDB data store, REST api
and Socket.io real-time client/server api.
